express 5 
*splat matches any path without the root path. 
If you need to match the root path as well /, you can use /{*splat}, wrapping the wildcard in braces.

app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, "../frontend/dist")): This tells your Express server to serve static files (like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images) directly from the frontend/dist folder. It's how your web browser gets the actual files that make up your website's interface.

app.get("/{*splat}", ...): This is a catch-all route for your Single Page Application (SPA). 
If a user requests any URL that isn't an API endpoint or a specific static file, this line ensures that the server always sends back your index.html file. 
This allows your frontend JavaScript (e.g., React Router) to then handle the specific URL and render the correct page on the client side.

we dont need to specify NODE_ENV in .env as render know that this is the production environment and set it itself
